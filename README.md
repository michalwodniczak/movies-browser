## General Info
### Overview
Movies Browser is a web application created as part of a 4-week group project, marking the culmination of our Frontend Developer course at the YouCode online programming school. Our teamwork was organized using Scrum, and we managed tasks through Trello. For design, we utilized Figma, and data for the application is sourced from The Movie Database API.

This project enriched our skills in collaborative teamwork, focusing on effective communication, code reviews within the team, creating and reviewing pull requests, and working on code under time pressure to meet project deadlines. We also gained valuable experience in Scrum methodology, participated in daily stand-ups within our team, and engaged in weekly check-ins with our mentor, who assumed the role of the client/product owner, evaluating our progress. This comprehensive experience has allowed us to grow as developers and navigate various aspects of real-world project development.

- CSS Loader & Style Loader (for handling CSS in the build process)

Feel free to explore the demo and join us on this exciting journey of building the Movies Browser! If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your interest and support!

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm run deploy`
This script is available for deployment and is responsible for deploying the app to GitHub Pages. Use it to showcase your project to the world!

#### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
